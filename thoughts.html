                I yearn to someday be as good at writing as I am at thinking. The internal monologue feels sophisticated and elegant and nimble and lively, but whenever I try to externalize it, I struggle to capture the magic. If I labor long enough I can usually succeed, but I often find myself frustrated by the absence of any feeling of flow during the process. So for now, most of the time, I write because I love the result and not because I enjoy the act itself. But I hope that with practice the transfer from mind to keyboard will become more effortless.
