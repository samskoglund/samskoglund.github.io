            <p><b>Hello, Traveler!</b></p>
            <p>
                <br>
                Welcome to my digital garden. Here, you’ll find a collection of my reflections, ponderings, and daydreams on a wide variety of topics. A public journal of sorts.
                <br><br>
                I’m partly doing this for myself, to record thoughts I like and to maintain a level of awakeness. But I’m thinking maybe you’ll enjoy it too. It’s hard to really get to know people in modern society. We’re all so busy being busy. But there’s always in-between time when you can read, and so I wonder if longer format social media like this could be a cool way to deepen connections.
                <br><br>

            <p><b>Happy reading!
