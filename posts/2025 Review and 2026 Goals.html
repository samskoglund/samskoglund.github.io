                I would like to say first that it feels a bit weird to be posting this right now. I had a first draft written weeks ago, but then the evil ones escalated their invasion into Minnesota and my consciousness lost all momentum. It's hard to think about or care about anything else right now. It feels wrong to think about or care about anything else right now. But if I don't finish this now I worry it won't happen until it's too late to mean anything, so I decided to finish it tonight despite the dissonance. Forgive me if it feels abbreviated in places.
            </p>

                Happy New Year, everyone! 2025 was the first year where I had goals written down, and I thought it'd be fun to review them here on the blog as well as share what's on my mind for 2026.
            </p>

            <br><hr><br>

            <p>
                The following are my 2025 goals and associated reflections.
                <br><br>

                <b>Run a marathon.</b>
                <br>
                This was the goal that I took the most seriously and am the most proud of achieving this year. I've dreamt about running a marathon for years and it unquestionably lived up to the high that I imagined it would be. Which is saying something, because my imagination tends to be hard to live up to. I've always felt like the best experiences in life are those that feel most like a story, and this journey has really felt like a story, full of yearning, learning, failure, more learning, more failure, and finally, success. You can read more in my blog posts <a href="2025-06-26 - I Finished a Marathon/2025-06-26 - I Finished a Marathon!.html">I Finished a Marathon</a> and <a href="2025-10-10 - Redemption/2025-10-10 - Redemption.html">Redemption</a>, which recount my first and second attempts respectively.

                <br><br>

                <b>Meet at least fifty new people.</b>
                <br>
                I don't know why I worded this one that way... What counts as meet? And why fifty? Anyways, I feel I met this goal in spirit regardless of the specifics. When I was younger I thought of myself as an introvert, but in recent years I've realized that really I'm a shy extrovert. People are by far the most interesting thing in this reality. I think I did a good job of not letting the shy part get in the way this year. I met a bunch of new people at running groups and a few more here and there through other means, and I also felt like I finally really "met" some people that I already "knew", if that makes sense.

                <br><br>

                <b>Go on at least three dates.</b>
                <br>
                I remember that when I wrote this I assumed it would be three dates with three different people, and that none of them would lead to anything. I set it as a goal simply so I could say to myself <i>at least you tried</i>. Yikes, past me. Yikes. Thankfully, things are looking up! In the interest of not oversharing, I'll keep this to one important and hard hitting reflection: I now feel immunized against the worry I once had. There are indeed people out there who I like who like me too.

                <br><br>

                <b>Grow my Obsidian notebook.</b>
                <br>
                In late 2024, I discovered Obsidian, which is a personal knowledge management tool that you can think of as a notes app on steroids. I quickly fell in love with it and made it a goal for 2025 to grow it into something really useful. I think I'm there. This software has changed the way my mind works. Seriously. It's become a place where my memories, relationships, ideas, and questions can actually persist instead of dissolving between moments of attention. I beg you to check it out, and feel free to ask me if you're curious to hear more about my experience with it. Maybe I'll write about it sometime. In the last year I've added around 35,000 words of journal entries, blog post drafts, and memory aids.
                
                <br><br>

                <b>Read at least six books.</b>
                <br>
                Seven. Overachieved, yay. Here's the list. The ones that have earned it have been added to <a href="Bookshelf/bookshelf.html">my bookshelf page</a>.
                <br><br>
                <u>The Anthropocene Reviewed by John Green</u>
                <br>
                5/5 stars. John Green is wonderfully alive/awake/aware.
                <br><br>
                <u>Turtles All the Way Down by John Green</u>
                <br>
                4/5 stars. Despite not being the intended audience for this one, it hit pretty hard.
                <br><br>
                <u>Death's End by Cixin Liu</u>
                <br>
                5/5 stars. The last of a trilogy. This one gets a spot on the "changed me" section of my bookshelf. It's sci fi on the surface but the underlying philosophy is what I found to be really special.
                <br><br>
                <u>The Communist Manifesto by Karl Marx and Frederick Engels</u>
                <br>
                5/5 stars. Really not as radical as they say.
                <br><br>
                <u>These Precious Days by Ann Patchett</u>
                <br>
                5/5 stars. I found myself pausing and thinking way more than usual. Is there any better indicator of a book's greatness? Reflections on the most important matters of life, from a perspective that felt new to me.
                <br><br>
                <u>At Day's Close by A. Roger Ekirch</u>
                <br>
                3/5 stars. This is the kind of book that you enjoy having read, but don't enjoy reading. Basically just a really long list of interesting anthropological facts and records about nighttime.
                <br><br>
                <u>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance by Robert M. Pirsig</u>
                <br>
                5/5 stars for the first half and 2/5 stars for the second half. For the first half, I was highlighting practically every line. I found his assessment of humanity's relationship with technology to be spot on, and I thought the way he crafted said assessment was especially artistic. The second half got way too pedantic but oh well. Overall totally worth the read.

                <br><br>

                <b>Publish a blog.</b>
                <br>
                You're here!

                <br><br>

                <b>Go on one destination climbing trip.</b>
                <br>
                This didn't happen, but I'm not too upset about it. It was worth it to sacrifice climbing this year in order to focus on running. Maybe next year I'll be enough of a beast to be in good running shape and good climbing shape at the same time.

                <br><br>

                <b>Go to the boundary waters.</b>
                <br>
                This one also didn't happen. I've lived in Minnesota my whole life and have never gone to the boundary waters and it's embarrassing and I want to make it happen. To the 2026 goals list it goes.

                <br><br>

                <b>Complete at least four creative projects.</b>
                <br>
                Frustratingly, I rarely have the kind of energy that is required for creative work when I get home from my job. I still haven't figured out how to manage that. The real solution is 32 hour work weeks, but of course that's outside of my control. Anyways, I did get a few things done that I'm excited about. The blog, a Three Body Problem simulator wall art thing, and a nordic ski waxing bench.

                <br><br>

                <b>Free myself from the influence of evil corporations as much as possible.</b>
                <br>
                About a year ago I started paying closer attention to the decline in usability of pretty much everything we all interact with on a daily basis. I awoke to the reality that end stage enshittification is here, and realized I must change in order to avoid becoming a sheep in the technofeudalists' pasture. The switching costs are high as the oligarchs designed, but I've made great progress overcoming them. I'll save the details for a future post, but as an example, I recently canceled Spotify, revived my iPod Nano from 2007, and am slowly curating a library of music that I actually own. As it turns out, reclaiming agency in a world being ravaged by the woes of capitalism is surprisingly enjoyable.

                <br><br>

                <b>Keep my apartment cleaner.</b>
                <br>
                Success! I often have some dirty dishes on the counter above my dishwasher, but other than that I've managed to be much tidier this year and it feels good.

                <br><br>

                <b>Snooze my alarm less.</b>
                <br>
                Nope. Failure. Complete and utter failure. I'm not even gonna put it on the list for 2026 because I know it's hopeless. The version of my mind that exists after midnight is my favorite version, and I'm not willing to sacrifice that by going to bed earlier. Why do morning people get to rule the world? Y'all are killing us night owls.
            </p>

            <br><hr><br>

            <p>
                The following are my 2026 goals and associated thoughts.
                <br><br>
                <b>Race a marathon.</b>
                <br>
                The key word here is "race". I've done two marathons so far. The first one I "finished", the second one I "ran", and now I really want to "race" one. It's not any specific pace or time that I'm chasing, but a feeling. Hard to describe, but hopefully that makes sense. In order to achieve this, I think I'll need to approach running much more professionally than I have so far. I'll need to take nutrition more seriously and be more deliberate with my pace and distance during training.
                <br><br>
                <b>Go on at least one destination climbing trip.</b>
                <br>
                Already have one planned. Yay! Red Rock Canyon in April. Maybe another later in the year.
                <br><br>
                <b>Go to the boundary waters.</b>
                <br>
                I probably won't prioritize this one but I'm hoping it'll fit on a weekend some time.
                <br><br>
                <b>Get involved in politics in some capacity.</b>
                <br>
                This one feels like a moral obligation at this point. I hate the feeling of sitting around and enjoying my privileged position in life while watching everything crumble. I've already taken some small steps, like going to protests, emailing congress people, talking to people around me, giving less money to evil, and educating myself. But I'd love to contribute more to the cause if I can figure out how. I followed Zohran Mamdani's campaign pretty closely and found it inspiring and hopeful. I'd love to get involved in a moment like that if a similar opportunity arises in Minnesota.
                <br><br>
                <b>Dream bigger.</b>
                <br>
                The closer attention I pay to history and current events, the more I realize that one person really can have a meaningful impact if they have a solid plan. And it seems like often times the ideas that end up being most impactful are the ones that are so outlandish they seem silly at first. With that in mind, I want to challenge myself to pursue my dreamy ideas a bit further than I have in the past. Spend more time writing about them and bringing them into conversation in order to develop them and see where they might go.
                <br><br>
                <b>Complete at least one creative project.</b>
                <br>
                Maybe this will finally be the year when I make the cloud chamber that I've been dreaming about for years. If you've never heard of a cloud chamber, it's basically a container of supersaturated alcohol vapor that allows you to visualize cosmic background radiation. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i15ef618DP0">Here's an example video</a>. Imagine having one on your coffee table. Would be so cool!
                <br><br>
                <b>Read at least six books.</b>
                <br>
                Same goal as last year. I have 28 books on my reading list.
                <br><br>
                <b>Write more.</b>
                <br>
                Or maybe this should be "finish more of my drafts." I get so excited to write about things, constantly creating new notes where I jot down a bunch of bullets and random zinger sentences, but often lose momentum before I work everything together into a coherent piece. I've got like a hundred drafts at this point. I think the solution is just more focused, distraction free practice, so that I can reduce the time it takes to go from a draft to a piece I'm proud of.
            </p>

            <br><hr><br>

            <p>
                Good luck in 2026, everyone! I encourage you all to spend some time reflecting and planning as well. I think it's important, even when the energy is hard to find amid everything else. I'd love to hear your goals, and if you need a copilot for any of them, consider my application submitted.
                <br><br>
                Full speed ahead!
            </p>
